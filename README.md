# Codsoft
During my internship at Codsoft, I had the opportunity to work on several impactful machine learning projects that enhanced my technical skills and provided practical experience in data analysis, model development, and performance evaluation. Over the course of my internship, I was involved in end-to-end machine learning workflows, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and validation. The following sections detail four key projects I worked on during my internship: Movie Prediction, Credit Card Fraud Detection,Customer Churn Analysis and Spam SMS Detection.


# Project 1: Movie Prediction
This project focuses on predicting movie success based on various features such as budget, genre, and release date. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the model aims to forecast box office revenue and other success metrics. The dataset includes historical data on movies, allowing for training and evaluation of different predictive models. Key steps in this project include data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ².

# Project 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of credit card transactions, each labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. Various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, are applied and compared based on their performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The goal is to develop a robust model that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

# Project 3: Customer Churn Analysis
The objective of this project is to predict customer churn in a business context. The dataset includes customer demographics, account information, and usage patterns. By analyzing this data, the project aims to identify the factors that contribute to customer churn and predict whether a customer is likely to leave the service. Techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model evaluation are employed. Models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting are tested and compared to find the most effective predictor of customer churn. 


# Project 4: Spam SMS Detection
The Spam SMS Detection project focuses on identifying and filtering out spam messages from legitimate SMS communications using machine learning techniques. The dataset comprises a collection of SMS messages labeled as 'spam' or 'ham' (legitimate). The project involves text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization using techniques like TF-IDF. Various classification algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest, are implemented and evaluated to determine the most effective model for spam detection. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the models' efficacy.
